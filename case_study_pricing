--1. If a Meat Lovers pizza costs $12 and Vegetarian costs $10 and there were no charges for changes - how much money has Pizza Runner made so far if there are no delivery fees?

SELECT 
    SUM(CASE 
            WHEN co.pizza_id = 1 THEN 12
            WHEN co.pizza_id = 2 THEN 10
            ELSE 0 
        END) AS total_revenue
FROM customer_orders co;;

--2. What if there was an additional $1 charge for any pizza extras? Add cheese is $1 extra

SELECT 
    SUM(CASE 
            WHEN co.pizza_id = 1 THEN 12
            WHEN co.pizza_id = 2 THEN 10
            ELSE 0 
        END)

            WHEN co.extras IS NOT NULL OR co.extras = '' OR co.extras = 'NaN' THEN 
                array_length(regexp_split_to_array(co.extras, ','), 1)
            ELSE 0 
        END) AS total_revenue_with_extras
FROM customer_orders co;

--3. If a Meat Lovers pizza was $12 and Vegetarian $10 fixed prices with no cost for extras and each runner is paid $0.30 per kilometre traveled - how much money does Pizza Runner have left over after these deliveries?

SELECT SUM(CASE
       WHEN co.pizza_id = 1 THEN 12
       WHEN co.pizza_id = 2 THEN 10
       ELSE 0
       END) - SUM(tro.distance*0.3) as left_over
FROM customer_orders co
JOIN temp_runner_orders tro
	ON tro.order_id = co.order_id
WHERE tro.cancellation IS NULL;
